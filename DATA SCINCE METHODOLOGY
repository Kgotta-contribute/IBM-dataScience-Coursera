QUIZ 3:




























FINAL ASSIGNMENT

In this Assignment, you will demonstrate your understanding of the data science methodology by 
applying it to a given problem. Pick one of the following topics to apply the data science methodology to:

    Emails

    Hospitals

    Credit Cards

You will have to play the role of the client as well as the data scientist to come up with a problem that 
is more specific but related to these topics.
I will choose the topic of "Credit Cards" for this assignment.

As a client, my problem is that I am experiencing high levels of credit card debt and would like to find a way 
to manage my finances better. I would like to identify patterns in my spending and debt that can help me create a budget and pay off my debt faster.

As a data scientist, I will follow the data science methodology to address this problem:

Problem Understanding:
The problem is that the client is experiencing high levels of credit card debt and wants to identify 
patterns in their spending and debt to create a budget and pay off the debt faster.

Data Collection:
To address this problem, I will collect the following data:
Credit card statements from the past 6 months
Bank statements from the past 6 months
Expense tracker data (if available)

Data Preparation:
After collecting the data, I will clean and transform it as follows:
Convert all amounts to a common currency and remove any irrelevant columns
Categorize expenses into different categories such as food, transportation, entertainment, etc.
Calculate the total amount of debt and interest paid on the credit cards
Merge the data into a single dataset for analysis

Data Analysis:
Using the prepared data, I will analyze the patterns in the client's spending and debt. Specifically, I will:
Identify the top categories of expenses
Calculate the debt-to-income ratio to determine the client's ability to pay off the debt
Identify any recurring expenses that can be reduced or eliminated
Identify any opportunities to consolidate debt or negotiate lower interest rates
Create a budget and debt repayment plan based on the analysis

Model Building:
I will not build any models for this problem.

Presentation and Visualization:
I will present my findings to the client in a clear and concise manner, using visualizations such as graphs and 
charts to illustrate the patterns and trends in their spending and debt. I will also provide recommendations on how 
to create a budget and pay off the debt faster based on the analysis.

Deployment:
The client can implement the budget and debt repayment plan immediately after the presentation, and continue to 
track their spending and debt to ensure they are staying on track with their financial goals.
